# this file. This can also be set on the command line using: -Dspring.profile.active=local
# NOTE: The name of the active profile cannot have dashes in it -- spring may parse the override name incorrectly.

## Logging configuration
# For more details see https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/boot-features-logging.html
# Note that Spring takes logging.dir and puts its value into LOG_PATH, which is used in the logback-spring.xml configuration file.

# logging.level.<logger-name>=<level> where level is one of TRACE, DEBUG, INFO, WARN, ERROR, FATAL, or OFF.
# The root logger can be configured by using logging.level.root
